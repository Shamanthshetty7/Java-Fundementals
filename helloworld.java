//print" hello world' in java

// class name and the program file(stored as .class extension)always should be same.

public class classname{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

//execution always starts from main...
//all the operations are same as c and c++ ...only syntax difference you can see including some inner process difference.
